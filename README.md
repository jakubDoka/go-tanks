# go-tanks

For now this is just one super annoying game where computer proves you that you don`t know how to play. Its actually made for community to build. All levels and tanks already in game are made by builtin modding language, that can be utilized by anyone to make your own game and rules. 

## ambitions

I don't have too big expectations as game is really small and simple. It can get interesting though, when multiplayer will be added. Yes if AI (just an if statements) in game is too strong, its always good to have option to bust some real players. Making an online game is complex though. I can only invest by time into it if there is someone who can enjoy the product. (need a good mood to code as well)

Most important though, are your ideas. I am a coder (or at least i think so), but am really bad at creating content. Thats also why all content in game is created by mods. I need ideas and goals to be productive! Best way to make your idea real, is to share them with me, and believe me, almost everything is possible (except 3D, I am not doing that).

## modding

Now that we gone over some boring stuff, lets make it even worse. I will now briefly go over all modding capability that is offered for you as a user.
